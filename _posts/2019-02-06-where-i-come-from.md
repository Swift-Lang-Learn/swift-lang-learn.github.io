Hi!  Thanks from dropping by!

I hope you find the information in this blog useful.  My purpose in creating it is to share with you my experiences and insights as I work to become a Swift/iOS developer.  I've just started on this path so necessarily, the informtion you find here will be most useful for beginners, initially.  As I grow and learn, I will share what I learn here, especially those things that I have a great deal of trouble understanding.  The goal will be to take what I have trouble understanding and presenting it in a way that's not difficult to understand.

Now, a bit more information about me will clarify some questions you may have if you're planning on visiting often - I'm not a total beginner when it comes to programming.  At the same time, I'm not an expert in any programming language - I've only dabbled and then there were those Unix shell and Perl scripts I had to write for my work as a Unix admin.  Given this, you won't find very basic info when it comes to Swift, for instance, how loops work, or conditional statements.  I've found the Swift community to be a vibrant one and there are plenty of great learning resources out there.  I will link to them in future posts.
